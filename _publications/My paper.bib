   abstract = {Abnormal grain growth can occur in polycrystalline materials with only a fraction of grains growing drastically to consume other grains. Here we report abnormal grain growth in ultrafine grained metal in a rarely explored high-cycle loading regime at ambient temperature. Abnormal grain growth is observed in electroplated Ni microbeams with average initial grain sizes less than 640 nm under a large number of loading cycles (up to 109) with low strain amplitudes (< 0.3%). Such abnormal grain growth occurs predominantly in the family of grains whose <100> orientation is along the tensile/compressive loading direction. Micromechanics analysis suggests that the elastic anisotropy of grains dictates the thermodynamic driving force of abnormal grain growth, such that the lowest strain energy density of the <100> oriented grain family dominates grain growth. This work unveils a unique type of abnormal grain growth that may be harnessed to tailor grain microstructures in materials.},

   abstract = {The strength-controlling dislocation mechanism of a material can be illuminated by partition of the flow stress into its effective stress and back stress components. Recent experiments report a nearly constant saturated effective stress of about 100 MPa for nanotwinned Cu with a range of nanotwin thicknesses less than 100 nm [Z. Cheng et.al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 119 (2022) e2116808119]. This surprising result implies that the effective stress is controlled by the long dislocations spanning multiple nanotwin lamellae, termed trans-twin dislocations, rather than the commonly thought threading dislocations confined within individual nanotwin lamellae. Here we use molecular dynamics to simulate the formation and motion of trans-twin dislocations across multiple nanotwin lamellae. We show that the interconnected segments of a trans-twin dislocation can glide concertedly on the corrugated {111} slip planes in consecutive nanotwin lamellae with little resistance from coherent twin boundaries. Our results indicate that the finite resistance to slip transmission across coherent twin boundaries can set a lower limit of the effective obstacle spacing to hinder dislocation glide and thus dictate the upper limit of the saturated effective stress of nanotwinned metals. This work provides new understanding of the strength-controlling mechanism in nanotwinned metals.},

   abstract = {Additively manufactured (AM) metallic materials commonly possess substantial microscale internal stresses that manifest as intergranular and intragranular residual stresses. However, the impact of these residual stresses on the mechanical behaviour of AM materials remains unexplored. Here we combine in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments and computational modelling to quantify the lattice strains in different families of grains with specific orientations and associated intergranular residual stresses in an AM 316L stainless steel under uniaxial tension. We measure pronounced tension–compression asymmetries in yield strength and work hardening for as-printed stainless steel, and show they are associated with back stresses originating from heterogeneous dislocation distributions and resultant intragranular residual stresses. We further report that heat treatment relieves microscale residual stresses, thereby reducing the tension–compression asymmetries and altering work-hardening behaviour. This work establishes the mechanistic connections between the microscale residual stresses and mechanical behaviour of AM stainless steel.},

   abstract = {The emergence of multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) holds great promise for the development of high performance metallic materials. However, it remains unclear whether MPEAs can provide previously unknown deformation mechanisms to drastically enhance their mechanical performance. Here we report a new deformation mechanism of mechanically-induced dual phase transformations from the face-centered cubic (FCC) to hexagonal close- packed (HCP) phase and then back to the FCC phase with nanotwins in a CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy (MEA). During the two sequential steps of phase transformation, continued shear occurs in the same 〈110〉FCC∥〈112¯0〉HCPdirection along different {111}FCC∥(0001)HCP planes, producing a total shear transformation strain up to 70%. The dual phase transformations stem from a unique capability of facile slip in between the close-packed {111}FCC∥(0001)HCP atomic layers in both FCC and HCP phases, leading to flexible stacking sequences of those close-packed layers with low stacking fault energies. Our work demonstrates that MPEAs can offer unconventional deformation mechanisms such as dual phase transformations in the CrCoNi MEA, thereby opening opportunities for enhancing the mechanical properties of advanced alloys.},

   abstract = {Materials containing heterogeneous nanostructures hold great promise for achieving superior mechanical properties. However, the strengthening effect due to plastically inhomogeneous deformation in heterogeneous nanostructures has not been clearly understood. Here, we investigate a prototypical heterogeneous nanostructured material of gradient nanotwinned (GNT) Cu to unravel the origin of its extra strength arising from gradient nanotwin structures relative to uniform nanotwin counterparts. We measure the back and effective stresses of GNT Cu with different nanotwin thickness gradients and compare them with those of homogeneous nanotwinned Cu with different uniform nanotwin thicknesses. We find that the extra strength of GNT Cu is caused predominantly by the extra back stress resulting from nanotwin thickness gradient, while the effective stress is almost independent of the gradient structures. The combined experiment and strain gradient plasticity modeling show that an increasing structural gradient in GNT Cu produces an increasing plastic strain gradient, thereby raising the extra back stress. The plastic strain gradient is accommodated by the accumulation of geometrically necessary dislocations inside an unusual type of heterogeneous dislocation structure in the form of bundles of concentrated dislocations. Such a heterogeneous dislocation structure produces microscale internal stresses leading to the extra back stress in GNT Cu. Altogether, this work establishes a fundamental connection between the gradient structure and extra strength in GNT Cu through the mechanistic linkages of plastic strain gradient, heterogeneous dislocation structure, microscale internal stress, and extra back stress. Broadly, this work exemplifies a general approach to unraveling the strengthening mechanisms in heterogeneous nanostructured materials.},

   abstract = {Gradient nanostructured (GNS) metals exhibit high overall extra strengths relative to their non-gradient counterparts. However, the spatial distribution of local extra strengths stemming from plastic strain gradients remains elusive. This work is focused on characterizing the gradient distribution of plastic strains in a representative GNS metal of gradient nanotwinned (GNT) Cu. Full-field strain mapping reveals the gradient distributions of lateral strains in the transverse cross section of GNT Cu samples undergoing uniaxial tensile deformation. We find that the lateral strain gradient increases but the maximum lateral strain difference decreases in GNT samples with increasing structural gradient. The latter arises because the softest layer with the lowest initial yield strength gains the largest local extra strength during tensile deformation, and vice versa. Such a gradient distribution of local extra strengths results from the combined strengthening effects of plastic strain gradient and grain size. These experimental results are used to inform a strain gradient plasticity model for revealing the gradient distributions of local extra back stresses and local extra strengths with increasing load. The coupled experimental and modeling characterization of gradient plastic deformation provides an in-depth mechanistic understanding of the spatial-temporal evolution of gradient strengthening effects in gradient nanostructures.},

Nevertheless, the underlying atomic-scale mechanisms of dislocation climb have not been explored by direct experimental observations. Here, we report atomic-scale observations of grain boundary (GB) dislocation climb in nanostructured Au during in situ straining at room temperature. The climb of a edge dislocation is found to occur by stress-induced reconstruction of two neighboring atomic columns at the edge of an extra half atomic plane in the dislocation core. This is different from the conventional belief of dislocation climb by destruction or construction of a single atomic column at the dislocation core. The atomic route of the dislocation climb we proposed is demonstrated to be energetically favorable by Monte Carlo simulations. Our in situ observations also reveal GB evolution through dislocation climb at room temperature, which suggests a means of controlling microstructures and properties of nanostructured metals.},

Here we perform gradient plasticity finite element (GPFE) simulations of nanoindentation of additively manufactured stainless steel layers on stainless steel baseplates. The GPFE simulation results, when compared with their experimental nanoindentation counterparts, capture the size dependence of indentation hardness arising from strong plastic strain gradients developed at small indentation depths. Furthermore, they address the strengthening effects due to the interplay of several characteristic length scales involved, including the indentation depth, the grain size, and the size of printing-induced dislocation cells. This work demonstrates that GPFE simulations can be effectively applied for quantitative evaluation and mechanistic understanding of the nanoindentation behavior of additively manufactured materials.},

   abstract = {High-entropy alloys are a class of materials that contain five or more elements in near-equiatomic proportions1,2. Their unconventional compositions and chemical structures hold promise for achieving unprecedented combinations of mechanical properties3–8. Rational design of such alloys hinges on an understanding of the composition–structure–property relationships in a near-infinite compositional space9,10. Here we use atomic-resolution chemical mapping to reveal the element distribution of the widely studied face-centred cubic CrMnFeCoNi Cantor alloy2 and of a new face-centred cubic alloy, CrFeCoNiPd. In the Cantor alloy, the distribution of the five constituent elements is relatively random and uniform. By contrast, in the CrFeCoNiPd alloy, in which the palladium atoms have a markedly different atomic size and electronegativity from the other elements, the homogeneity decreases considerably; all five elements tend to show greater aggregation, with a wavelength of incipient concentration waves11,12 as small as 1 to 3 nanometres. The resulting nanoscale alternating tensile and compressive strain fields lead to considerable resistance to dislocation glide. In situ transmission electron microscopy during straining experiments reveals massive dislocation cross-slip from the early stage of plastic deformation, resulting in strong dislocation interactions between multiple slip systems. These deformation mechanisms in the CrFeCoNiPd alloy, which differ markedly from those in the Cantor alloy and other face-centred cubic high-entropy alloys, are promoted by pronounced fluctuations in composition and an increase in stacking-fault energy, leading to higher yield strength without compromising strain hardening and tensile ductility. Mapping atomic-scale element distributions opens opportunities for understanding chemical structures and thus providing a basis for tuning composition and atomic configurations to obtain outstanding mechanical properties.},

   abstract = {Understanding the oxidation behavior of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is essential to their practical applications. Here we conducted in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) observations of dynamic oxidation processes in CrMnFeCoNi and CrFeCoNiPd nanoparticles (NPs) near room temperature. During the oxidation of CrMnFeCoNi NPs, a favorable oxidation product was MnCr2O4 with the spinel structure. The surface nanoislands of MnCr2O4 underwent dynamic reconstruction, resulting in the thickened oxide layer with less crystallinity. In CrFeCoNiPd NPs, the reactive element Mn was replaced by the inert element Pd. As a result, a favorable oxide product was CrO2 with the rutile structure. CrO2 formed on the NP surface and was a result of Cr outward diffusion through the oxide layer. In addition, FeO nanocrystals formed at the oxide/metal interface and were a result of O inward diffusion through the oxide layer. We also performed first principles calculations to provide insights into the energetics and diffusion rates related to oxide formation. These results reveal the non-equilibrium processes of oxidation in HEA NPs that can be strongly influenced by small particle sizes and large surface areas. This work underscores the high tunability of oxidation behavior in nanoscale HEAs by changing their constituent alloying elements.},

Here we report a “nanodispersion-in-nanograins” strategy to simultaneously strengthen and stabilize nanocrystalline metals such as copper and nickel. Our strategy relies on a uniform dispersion of extremely fine sized carbon nanoparticles (2.6 ± 1.2 nm) inside nanograins. The intragranular dispersion of nanoparticles not only elevates the strength of already-strong nanograins by 35%, but also activates multiple hardening mechanisms via dislocation-nanoparticle interactions, leading to improved work hardening and large tensile ductility. In addition, these finely dispersed nanoparticles result in substantially enhanced thermal stability and electrical conductivity in metal nanocomposites. Our results demonstrate the concurrent improvement of several mutually exclusive properties in metals including strength-ductility, strength-thermal stability, and strength-electrical conductivity, and thus represent a promising route to engineering high-performance nanostructured materials.},

   abstract = {Additive manufacturing produces net-shaped components layer by layer for engineering applications1–7. The additive manufacture of metal alloys by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) involves large temperature gradients and rapid cooling2,6, which enables microstructural refinement at the nanoscale to achieve high strength. However, high-strength nanostructured alloys produced by laser additive manufacturing often have limited ductility3. Here we use L-PBF to print dual-phase nanolamellar high-entropy alloys (HEAs) of AlCoCrFeNi2.1 that exhibit a combination of a high yield strength of about 1.3 gigapascals and a large uniform elongation of about 14 per cent, which surpasses those of other state-of-the-art additively manufactured metal alloys. The high yield strength stems from the strong strengthening effects of the dual-phase structures that consist of alternating face-centred cubic and body-centred cubic nanolamellae; the body-centred cubic nanolamellae exhibit higher strengths and higher hardening rates than the face-centred cubic nanolamellae. The large tensile ductility arises owing to the high work-hardening capability of the as-printed hierarchical microstructures in the form of dual-phase nanolamellae embedded in microscale eutectic colonies, which have nearly random orientations to promote isotropic mechanical properties. The mechanistic insights into the deformation behaviour of additively manufactured HEAs have broad implications for the development of hierarchical, dual- and multi-phase, nanostructured alloys with exceptional mechanical properties.},

Deformation-induced grain growth was observed to occur via stress-assisted grain boundary migration with extensive grain growth occurring in the necked region, indicating that the increase in local stress drives the boundary migration. Under applied tensile stresses close to the ultimate tensile strength of 450 MPa for a nanocrystalline Al specimen, measured boundary migration speeds are 0.2 – 0.7 nm s−1 for grains outside necked region and increases to 2.5 nm s−1 for grains within the necked region where the local estimated tensile stresses are elevated to around 630 MPa. By tracking grain boundary motion over time, molecular dynamics simulations showed qualitative agreement in terms of pronounced grain boundary migration with the experimental observations. The combined in situ observation and molecular dynamics simulation results underscore the important role of stress-driven grain growth in plastically deforming nanocrystalline metals, leading to intergranular fracture through predominant grain boundary sliding in regions with large localized deformation.},

   abstract = {Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging relies on high energy electrons for atomic scale resolution, however, the electrons themselves interact with and may alter the material being imaged. Using an in situ TEM MEMS-based nanomechanical testing technique, the effect of the electron beam (e-beam) on the deformation behavior of nanocrystalline Al and ultrafine-grained Au is investigated and quantified. We show that the e-beam enhances plastic deformation, leading to an increase in plastic strain rate and a decrease in true activation volume V* in Al (28 to 21b3, with b being the Burgers vector length). The e-beam has a much weaker effect on Au. The e-beam effect is not caused by knock-on damage, but rather an effective temperature increase due to additional atomic fluctuations provided by the e-beam. The effective temperature increase is larger for Al than Au. This e-beam effect does not change the deformation mechanisms, but instead accelerates the stress-driven, thermally activated plastic deformation. These experiments provide insight into the effects of the e-beam on plastic deformation in different metals and underscore the importance of understanding and quantifying these effects for proper interpretation of measured mechanical properties during in situ TEM experiments.},

   abstract = {Nickel-titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloys (SMA) are widely used, however simulating the martensitic transformation of NiTi from first principles remains challenging. In this work, we developed a neural network interatomic potential (NNIP) for near-equiatomic Ni-Ti system through active-learning based acquisitions of density functional theory (DFT) training data, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Phonon dispersion and potential-of-mean-force calculations of the temperature-dependent free energy have been carried out. This NNIP predicts temperature-induced, stress-induced, and defect-induced martensitic transformations from atomic simulations, in significant agreement with experiments. The NNIP can directly simulate the superelasticity of NiTi nanowires, providing a tool to guide their design.},

   abstract = {In situ TEM experiments reveal the crystalline-to-amorphous phase transformation in an ultrafine-grained Cantor alloy. The Cantor high-entropy alloy (HEA) of CrMnFeCoNi is a solid solution with a face-centered cubic structure. While plastic deformation in this alloy is usually dominated by dislocation slip and deformation twinning, our in situ straining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments reveal a crystalline-to-amorphous phase transformation in an ultrafine-grained Cantor alloy. We find that the crack-tip structural evolution involves a sequence of formation of the crystalline, lamellar, spotted, and amorphous patterns, which represent different proportions and organizations of the crystalline and amorphous phases. Such solid-state amorphization stems from both the high lattice friction and high grain boundary resistance to dislocation glide in ultrafine-grained microstructures. The resulting increase of crack-tip dislocation densities promotes the buildup of high stresses for triggering the crystalline-to-amorphous transformation. We also observe the formation of amorphous nanobridges in the crack wake. These amorphization processes dissipate strain energies, thereby providing effective toughening mechanisms for HEAs.},

   abstract = {Tungsten nanowires showed an unexpected anti-twinning phenomenon, which is strongly size-dependent. Nanomaterials often surprise us with unexpected phenomena. Here, we report a discovery of the anti-twinning deformation, previously thought impossible, in nanoscale body-centered cubic (BCC) tungsten crystals. By conducting in situ transmission electron microscopy nanomechanical testing, we observed the nucleation and growth of anti-twins in tungsten nanowires with diameters less than about 20 nm. During anti-twinning, a shear displacement of 1/3?111? occurs on every successive {112} plane, in contrast to an opposite shear displacement of 1/6?1?1?1?? by ordinary twinning. This asymmetry in the atomic-scale shear pathway leads to a much higher resistance to anti-twinning than ordinary twinning. However, anti-twinning can become active in nanosized BCC crystals under ultrahigh stresses, due to the limited number of plastic shear carriers in small crystal volumes. Our finding of the anti-twinning phenomenon has implications for harnessing unconventional deformation mechanisms to achieve high mechanical preformation by nanomaterials.},

   abstract = {Grain boundaries (GBs) play an important role in the mechanical behavior of polycrystalline materials. Despite decades of investigation, the atomic-scale dynamic processes of GB deformation remain elusive, particularly for the GBs in polycrystals, which are commonly of the asymmetric and general type. We conducted an in situ atomic-resolution study to reveal how sliding-dominant deformation is accomplished at general tilt GBs in platinum bicrystals. We observed either direct atomic-scale sliding along the GB or sliding with atom transfer across the boundary plane. The latter sliding process was mediated by movements of disconnections that enabled the transport of GB atoms, leading to a previously unrecognized mode of coupled GB sliding and atomic plane transfer. These results enable an atomic-scale understanding of how general GBs slide in polycrystalline materials. The behavior of grain boundaries in metals during deformation is important because it can dictate the macroscopic behavior. Lihua et al. used aberration-corrected in situ electron microscopy observation of platinum grain boundaries during straining to detail how they evolve. The authors observed grain boundary sliding, which is a well-known and expected mechanism. However, the authors also observed a unexpected mechanism that involves the removal of lattice planes at the grain boundaries. Their observations show the importance of using very-high-resolution microscopy to understand the role of grain boundaries during deformation. ?BG Electron microscopy shows that platinum grain boundaries evolve in unexpected ways during straining.},

   abstract = {Many traditional approaches for strengthening steels typically come at the expense of useful ductility, a dilemma known as strength–ductility trade-off. New metallurgical processing might offer the possibility of overcoming this. Here we report that austenitic 316L stainless steels additively manufactured via a laser powder-bed-fusion technique exhibit a combination of yield strength and tensile ductility that surpasses that of conventional 316L steels. High strength is attributed to solidification-enabled cellular structures, low-angle grain boundaries, and dislocations formed during manufacturing, while high uniform elongation correlates to a steady and progressive work-hardening mechanism regulated by a hierarchically heterogeneous microstructure, with length scales spanning nearly six orders of magnitude. In addition, solute segregation along cellular walls and low-angle grain boundaries can enhance dislocation pinning and promote twinning. This work demonstrates the potential of additive manufacturing to create alloys with unique microstructures and high performance for structural applications.},

Here we report in situ observations of electrochemically induced Li deposition under a CO2 atmosphere inside an environmental transmission electron microscope. We find that the morphology of individual Li deposits is strongly influenced by the competing processes of cracking and self-healing of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). When cracking overwhelms self-healing, the directional growth of Li whiskers predominates. In contrast, when self-healing dominates over cracking, the isotropic growth of round Li particles prevails. The Li deposition rate and SEI constituent can be tuned to control the Li morphologies. We reveal a new “weak-spot” mode of Li dendrite growth, which is attributed to the operation of the Bardeen-Herring growth mechanism in the whisker’s cross section. This work has implications for the control of Li dendrite growth in Li batteries.},

Here we use a self-consistent micromechanics model to obtain a general analytic solution of the grain-level lattice strains and diffraction elastic constants for a broad class of elastically isotropic polycrystals with cubic crystal symmetry. This analytic solution reveals a direct linear relationship between the reciprocal of the elastic diffraction constant and the orientation index parameter along the direction of any diffraction vector, including tensile loading and transverse directions. The straightforward numerical implementation of this solution provides diffraction elastic constants for 26 representative cubic polycrystals. Analytic solutions of this kind can serve to benchmark in situ diffraction measurements of lattice strains and also facilitate high-throughput studies of microscale stresses and diffraction elastic constants in polycrystalline materials.},

This strengthening effect originates from the plastic strain gradients arising in plastically deformed gradient structures. Here we develop a gradient theory of plasticity by incorporating the strengthening effect of plastic strain gradients into the classical J2 flow theory. This gradient theory is numerically implemented to study the strain gradient plasticity in gradient nanotwinned (GNT) Cu with different twin thickness gradients and accordingly different built-in strength gradients. Numerical simulations reveal the primary features of gradient plasticity in GNT Cu under uniaxial tension, including progressive yielding, gradient distributions of plastic strain and extra plastic flow resistance. The combined simulation and experimental results show that the extra strength of GNT Cu depends on the square root of the built-in strength gradient and also on the square root of the saturated plastic strain gradient in fully yielded GNT samples. This finding enables the predictions of optimal gradient structures and associated gradient strength distributions, which suggest possible routes for achieving the maximum strength of GNT Cu.},

   abstract = {Additively manufactured (AM) metallic materials often comprise as-printed dislocation cells inside grains. These dislocation cells can give rise to substantial microscale internal stresses in both initial undeformed and plastically deformed samples, thereby affecting the mechanical properties of AM metallic materials. Here we develop models of microscale internal stresses in AM stainless steel by focusing on their back stress components. Three sources of microscale back stresses are considered, including the printing and deformation-induced back stresses associated with as-printed dislocation cells as well as the deformation-induced back stresses associated with grain boundaries. We use a three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics model to demonstrate the manifestation of printing-induced back stresses. We adopt a dislocation pile-up model to evaluate the deformation-induced back stresses associated with as-printed dislocation cells. The extracted back stress relation from the pile-up model is incorporated into a crystal plasticity (CP) model that accounts for the other two sources of back stresses as well. The CP finite element simulation results agree with the experimentally measured tension–compression asymmetry and macroscopic back stress, the latter of which represents the effective resultant of microscale back stresses of different origins. Our results provide an in-depth understanding of the origins and evolution of microscale internal stresses in AM metallic materials.},

As a result, the non-uniform displacement field from a deformed sample with geometrical inhomogeneities can be used for training NNs. Such full-field data have the advantage of providing many different stress–strain paths at different locations in the sample by a single test, thereby enabling the highly efficient training of NNs. We apply FEM-NN simulations to learn the constitutive relations of several model materials characterized by rate-independent J2 plasticity. These FEM-NN studies demonstrate that the trained NNs produce the constitutive relations of plasticity with high accuracy and efficiency.},

While cracking in ceramic SEs has been often shown to accompany Li penetration, the interplay between Li deposition and cracking remains elusive. Here, we constructed a mesoscale SSB inside a focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) for in?situ observation of Li deposition-induced cracking in SEs at nanometer resolution. Our results revealed that Li propagated predominantly along transgranular cracks in a garnet Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO). Cracks appeared to initiate from the interior of LLZTO beneath the electrode surface and then propagated by curving toward the LLZTO surface. The resulting bowl-shaped cracks resemble those from hydraulic fracture caused by high fluid pressure on the surface of internal cracks, suggesting that the Li deposition-induced pressure is the major driving force of crack initiation and propagation. The high pressure generated by Li deposition is further supported by in?situ observation of the flow of filled Li between the crack flanks, causing crack widening and propagation. This work unveils the dynamic interplay between Li deposition and cracking in SEs and provides insight into the mitigation of Li dendrite penetration in SSBs.},
