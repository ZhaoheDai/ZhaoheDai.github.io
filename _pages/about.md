My name is Zhaohe Dai. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanics and Engineering Science, College of Engineering, Peking University (PKU). I received my B.Sc. degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2013, M.S. degree in Solid Mechanics from the Institute of Mechanics in 2016, and Ph.D. in Solid Mechanics from the University of Texas at Austin in 2020. Before joining PKU in March 2022, I undertook postdoctoral research in the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, as a Marie Curie Fellow. 

My research experiences have allowed me to acquire knowledge in a number of general areas in mechanics and materials, includeing thin film mechanics, surface phenomena, interface mechanics, 2D materials, and nanocarbon-based composites. Most of my published works have been concerned with the mechanics of thin solids and liquids, particularly focusing on elasticity metrology, elastocapillarity, wrinkling instability, adhesion, and friction. In general, I am interested in understanding various aspects of how slender solids deform when interacting with other objects, including liquids, rigid and deformable substrates. 

You may find my research interests, detailed publications, and a full CV on this website. Interested in anything on this web? Please feel free to contact me by emailing daizhpku.edu.cn.
